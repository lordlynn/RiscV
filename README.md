# RISC V
This repository consists of 10 labratory activities created by Imagination Technologies (https://www.imaginationtech.com/) in order to learn the architecture of RISC V.

The labs were completed in order to evalaute their usefullness for new curriculum at GVSU teaching embedded architecture. 

The labs comprised of some verilog in order to add/modify peripherals in the SoC, as well as C and assembly programs that could run on the softcore. 

These labs were completed using a Nexys A7 Artix-7 FPGA board. (https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-a7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/)
